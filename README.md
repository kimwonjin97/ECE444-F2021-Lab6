## Pros and Cons of Test Driven Development (TDD):

* Pros:
  - Tests come first before the actual implementation of the features, thus we could only write the necessary codes that are needed for specific features.
  - In TDD, we consider one feature at a time, and all of the implementations come after writing the test case, so this forces our code structure to be more modular.
  - There is less debugging done during or end of implementation.
  - The codes become much easier to refactor since all the test suites are present.

* Cons:
  - There is no way to find bugs introduced within the test code and in the implementation code. Lack of understanding of features to be implemented will most likely lead to useless test cases.
  - More time should be spent on the actual implementation, so it will delay the development process.
  - Whenever the requirement changes, the test case has to be re-written thus, thus as mentioned before it will extend the time for the development.
